The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find an analysis of births from 2000 to 2014. I was able to show some interesting features of the distribution of births throughout the week.

**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 02

In this project, I explored a dataset of summer hit music. I was looking for things like recurring artists, and trends in song characteristics.

**Sample data visualization:**

(you can place your figures in the `figures/` folder and use the `![](path_to_picture)` option to add the pictures here)


## Project 03

In this project, I explored a dataset weather recording from the TPA airport in 2022.

### Moving Forward

I learned a great deal about dita visualization while working on these projects. I was able to break down the tools that I had at hand and fully understand the logic behind them. This allowed me to get the looks I wanted from my data in order to communicate to my audience in an engaging way.

I learned about the philosophy behind data visualization. I grew to understand not just how my I want my visualization to look, but also how I can expect them to be percieved.

In the future I plan to continue to work with these tools in order to keep growing my skills. Furthermore, I plan to leverage my skills wherever I can. The world will alwasy need more effective communication.
