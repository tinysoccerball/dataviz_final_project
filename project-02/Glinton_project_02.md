## Introduction

This is my submission for Data Visualization and Reproducible Research Mini Project 2.

## Data Overview

The data set I used was [all_billboard_summer_hits.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reisanar/datasets/master/all_billboard_summer_hits.csv)

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

The data did not require much processing however I did format the date to a date for easier analysis.


## Initial Plans
I planned to make a chart that showed 2 trend lines in order to see how they diverge or converge. With music, there are trends and seasonal interests so i expected that to show in the data.

## The story
Rihanna is incredibly dominant however this may not be surprising. I was, however, surprised to see names I had never heard of before such as "Wings" and "Donna Summer". They were incredibly high up considering they were foreign names to me.

## Principles
I Did my best to keep my graphs clean and readable. I focused on them being lightweight, not visually noisy, and efficiently communicating information.
